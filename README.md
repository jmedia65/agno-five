# Agno Five: The 5 Levels of AI Agents

![Agno Five Banner](https://placehold.co/1200x300?text=Agno+Five)

An interactive educational project demonstrating the 5 levels of AI agent architecture based on [Ashpreet Bedi](https://twitter.com/ashpreetbedi)'s framework. This project provides working demos for each level of agent complexity using the [Agno](https://agno.com) framework.

## üìö Overview

This project demonstrates the progressive complexity of AI agents, from simple instruction-following tools to complete agentic systems. As Ashpreet Bedi notes: **"Always start with level 1 and add complexity as needed."**

Each level builds upon the previous one:

1. **Level 1:** Agent with tools and instructions
2. **Level 2:** Agent with knowledge and storage
3. **Level 3:** Agent with memory and reasoning
4. **Level 4:** Multi-agent teams
5. **Level 5:** Agentic systems

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmedia65/agno-five.git
   cd agno-five
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

## üìã Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Navigate through the different levels using the sidebar. Each level includes:

- An explanation of the concept
- A live chat demo showing the agent in action
- Code examples that you can expand to see how it's implemented

```

## üíª Development

- This project uses Streamlit for the UI
- The agents are built using the Agno framework
- Local file-based databases (SQLite and LanceDB) are used for storage and vector search

## üåê Deployment

This project can be deployed using Docker and Render:

### Local Docker Deployment

1. Build and run the Docker container locally:

   ```bash
   # Build and start the container
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the application at http://localhost:8501

### Render Deployment with Persistent Storage

1. Create a Render account and connect your GitHub repository

2. Create a new Web Service:

   - Select "Docker" as the environment
   - Name your service (e.g., "agno-five")
   - Keep all other default Docker settings

3. Add environment variables:

   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key value

4. Create a disk for persistent storage:

   - In the "Disks" section, create a new disk
   - Set mount path to `/app/tmp`
   - Choose an appropriate size (start with 1GB)
   - This ensures your database files persist between deployments

5. Deploy your service:
   - Render will build and deploy your Docker container
   - Once complete, you'll get a URL to access your application

Note: For production deployment, consider:

- Creating API keys with usage limits
- Monitoring your disk usage as the vector database grows
- Adding proper error handling for API limits
