    Rarely does a model have all the information it needs to achieve its task, and we obviously can't jam everything

    Agents work best when they have a narrow scope (specialized to a domain) and a reasonably small set of tools (<10).

**APIs** (servers) that take in a request, asynchronously complete the task, and stream back the result.

Websockets can work here, but they are not an easy tech to work with. Agentic systems is where the money is, 
and what everyone is trying to build. Agno has released the Agent API, Agent UI, and detailed documentation 
to help AI engineers build better systems.
