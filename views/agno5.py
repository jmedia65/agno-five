    ### Why Agentic Systems Matter
    
    Agentic systems represent the commercial end-point of agent development:
    
    * They handle request routing, state management, and asynchronous processing
    * They provide robust APIs that other services can consume
    * They manage database connections, scaling, and deployment
    * They incorporate monitoring, evaluation, and continuous improvement
    
    As Ashpreet Bedi noted: "Agentic systems is where the $ is and what everyone is trying to build."

    ### Getting Started
    
    1. Explore the [Agent API](https://github.com/agno-agi/agent-api) for a production-ready foundation
    2. Learn about [Agno Workspaces](https://docs.agno.com/workspaces/introduction) for standardized codebases
    3. Start with the `agent-app` template: `ag ws create` (via Agno CLI)
    4. Run locally using Docker: `ag ws up`
    5. Deploy to AWS: `ag ws up prd:aws`
